# Harness Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers in the Harness community, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in the Harness community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

## Reporting
For incidents occurring in the Harness community, contact community-engineering@harness.io or use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezbICGabREywwpLauIJz68OrBxAjimiFt3SrxK9qnaxF8SzQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit with the option of remaining anonymous. You can expect a response within three business days. Use of an outside mediator can be requested when reporting or used at Harness staff's discretion. In general, contacting community-engineering@harness.io directly is preferred.

## Enforcement
Harnessâ€™ Community Relations committee enforces code of conduct issues. Both bodies try to resolve incidents without punishment, but may remove people from the project or Harness communities at their discretion.
